TicTacToe
=========

This is a TDD attempt to implement Tic-Tac-Toe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

Rules
-----
X always goes first.  
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either:
One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally  
All nine squares are filled.  
If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, that player wins.  
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
